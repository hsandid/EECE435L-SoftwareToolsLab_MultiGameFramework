# Educational Game Platform

Realized by Mehieddine Zeidan and Hadi Sandid during Fall 2020 for the course EECE 435L (Software Tools).

This Education Game Platform is written in C++ and uses the QT framework. It offers a registration/login system, and two separate games (Snakes and Ladders & Cabo).
